Once cleared, small lots could be repackaged into larger parcels for sale to private developers. Those developers would build modern housing and commercial developments. New people (whiter and wealthier than their predecessors) would move into the new homes. New businesses would rent space in the commercial structures. These new businesses and residents would stabilize municipal finances.</p>'
