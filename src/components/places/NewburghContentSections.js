Once cleared, small lots could be repackaged into larger parcels for sale to private developers. Those developers would build modern housing and commercial developments. New people (whiter and wealthier than their predecessors) would move into the new homes. New businesses would rent space in the commercial structures. These new businesses and residents would stabilize municipal finances.</p>'

The project will be a miserable failure if a future project does not extend from South Street to Water Street on both sides of Smith  and High Streets, and also should include First Street, both sides of Colden Street and South Water Street from Water Street to Washington Street. These areas must in the very near future be demolished, or whatever is built in the present area will be greatly reduced in value and effectiveness by the condition of the properties in the surrounding areas.&rdquo;</p>'

That was no longer true by 1960.<br>Between 1950 and 1960, the city&rsquo;s Black population more than doubled. Many were Southern migrants, part of what is known as the Great Migration. Between World War I and the 1970s, roughly six million African Americans moved from the rural South to the urban North in search of a better life. In Newburgh, these migrants made their homes in the eastern section of the city. (White property owners prevented them from settling anywhere else.)<br>During the same period of time, white city residents moved from east to west or to the suburbs. Federally-backed mortgages facilitated these moves, described collectively as white flight.</p>'
